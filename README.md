# Soccer Data Visualization Project âš½

This project visualizes soccer player performance metrics using **D3.js**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It features interactive components such as timelines, heatmaps, and goal visualizations to offer an insightful look into player data.

## Features

- **Interactive Timelines**: Display player milestones and key events with dynamic date ranges.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize shot locations, power, and frequency with real-time filtering.
- **Goal Visualizations**: Detailed representation of shots taken, using an SVG-based soccer goal layout.
- **Customizable**: Users can interact with the visualizations by hovering, clicking, and filtering through different time periods.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: For creating scalable vector graphics (SVG) and interactive data visualizations.
- **JavaScript**: For logic, event handling, and dynamic data manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the visual components.
- **SVG Graphics**: Used to simulate a soccer field and other visual elements.

## Data Processing

Data preprocessing was handled using:
- **JavaScript Sets** for efficient data filtering and deduplication.
- **D3.js filters** to clean and reduce the data size by 50%, improving performance.

## Usage

- Hover over countries or timeline events to view details.
- Use the timeline to filter data based on different time ranges.
- Click on a goal in the heatmap to see its details and related events.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive features such as zooming and panning.
- Implement real-time data updates for ongoing games or player performance.
